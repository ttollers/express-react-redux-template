Time for some <strong>blockbuster reds!</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Part One – Bordeaux</strong></p>\n\n<p>Claret, traditional-British for Bordeaux, has been a firm favourite of ours for centuries. The quintessential classic reds from high-esteemed villages such as Margaux, Pauillac and <strong>St. Emilion</strong> are those that are layered, complex and destined to develop over decades before being enjoyed. We will explore why this is and focus on the key grapes such as <strong>Cabernet Sauvignon</strong>, <strong>Merlot </strong>and <strong>Cabernet Franc</strong> to understand what makes good Bordeaux great.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Part Two – Rhone &amp; the South</strong></p>\n\n<p>In the South of France lies the <strong>Rhone Valley</strong>, its’ myriad of canals and its abundance of vineyards. Here we find the blockbuster <strong>Syrah (Shiraz)</strong> and its’ multifaceted styles. In addition we find the spicy <strong>Grenache</strong>, and these two grapes together exist because of the hot climate down here, making more intense and full-bodied wines. We’ll explore classics such as <strong>Chateauneuf-du-Pape</strong>, Vacqueras and Hermitage and compare them to their inexpensive counterparts dotted around Mediterranean coast in Southern France.</p>\n\n<p>All tastings include; minimum of 6 wines sourced locally so you can find them easily if you like them, full tasting notes, tasting sheet, use of professional tastings glasses and nibbles.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Places remaining: </strong>0</p>\n\n\t\t<p><strong>Course Date/Time: </strong>Tue 31st Jan 2017 at 7pm</p>\n\n\t\t<p><strong>Duration: </strong>2 hours</p>\n\n\t\t<p><strong>Venue: </strong>Fulham Wine Cellars</p>\n\n\n\n\t</div>\n\n\t<div>Event Price: £30.00\n\n\t\t</div>\n</div>\n",

By the end of the course you will be able too! <strong>We will compare Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah/Shiraz, Pinot Noir, Sauvignon Blanc, Riesling, Chardonnay and more</strong> from the best locations and producers from France and the New World.</p>\n\n<p>It is only when you taste these wines together that the differences really stand out. The comparisons can bring some amazing insights into wine styles. We will taste wines from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, California, and compare them with wines from the Loire, Burgundy, Bordeaux, Rhone, Alsace and Champagne.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Course Programme (4 sessions - all Tuesdays)</strong>:</p>\n\n<p><b>14th Feb</b> -  Burgundy &amp; Champagne vs - looking at Chardonnay and Pinot Noir <br><b>21st Feb</b> - Bordeaux vs - looking at Cabernet Sauvignon, Merlot, Semillon and Sauvignon Blanc (red, dry white and sweet white wines will be tasted)<br><strong>28th Feb</strong> - Loire vs - looking at Sauvignon Blanc, Chenin Blanc and Cabernet Franc <br><b>7th March</b> - Rhone and Alsace vs - looking at Grenache, Syrah and Riesling</p>\n\n<p><br>\n\nAll in all a fantastic opportunity to taste <strong>25-30 exciting wines</strong> and discover those you like best.

    "description": "<div>\n<div>\n\n\t\t<p><strong>J</strong>oin us to review the contest that has been in full-swing for the past 3 decades, <strong>Bordeaux versus the New World</strong>. At the forefront of the comparison lies the top first growths of Bordeaux against the boutique wineries of California, but the contest filters down throughout all the wines found in these two regions. In addition to comparing the <strong>Cabernet Sauvignons </strong>and <strong>Merlots</strong> of Bordeaux against the U.S we shall also look at Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In addition we'll look at the Sauvignon Blancs and Semillons of Bordeaux against the New World. This echoes the famous <strong>Judgement of Paris</strong> Tasting in 1976...</p>\n\n<p>Does the favoured climatic conditions of the New World suit these Bordeaux grape varieties more? Is it a triumph for the traditionalist or a victory for the modernist?
